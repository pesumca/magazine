The day where the genius minds come together to portray their creativity and vast learning to result in the growth of knowledge not just for one's self but in the aspect of the betterment of our society as well. Students from several colleges from all over Bangalore were seen getting inspired and motivated and were actively participating in several activities which were being held.

These activities were the collective ideas and efforts put in by the students of PES University. Most importantly the main star of the whole event was the display of the projects done by students. The students actively presented their projects to several interested onlookers and were judged based on their creativity, technology used as well as the way it was being presented. From our prestigious MCA department, we had a couple of students who keenly brought forward their ideas and made it a practical success.

There were several ideas and projects among which a few we’re the ‘Guess Master’ which was being presented by Shreya Nayak of class MCA-II (2018-2021) who actively demonstrated the working of the project where the basic motive was to create a game application which would allow the user to think of a Bollywood celebrity in their mind and the application would guess who that celebrity was by asking a series of questions leading to the answer. 
An ensemble learning method was used to predict the answer.

One such another project was ‘Baymax’ presented by Amruta of class MCA-II (2018-2021), the main aim of it was to reduce the time spent by a nurse in a hospital making sure the saline given to patients is not unattended when empty or when it needs to be changed. This project makes the work of a nurse easier as it automated the process. Also the next one is one of my favourites ‘The Smart Mirror’ being presented by Suraj Agni of MCA-II (2018-2021), the main motive of this piece was to create a device displaying the multimedia content such as time, date, weather etc.. as well enabling the user to interact with the mirror using voice commands. It comprises several facilities such as real-time data and information.

Similarly, there were several other projects being presented, in the form of art or was being depicted as a game which created a lot of interest among the viewers, by the other departments of our college such as the Management department, Engineering department as well as the Hotel management department. The day was filled with lots of fun and learning which persuaded and inspired the students to achieve new goals and it shall be cherished as a memorable day for all
