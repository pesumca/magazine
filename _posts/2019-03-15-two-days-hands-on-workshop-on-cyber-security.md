On the second day, Dr. Ram, started with the discussion on the goals of Web Security and common vulnerabilities in Web Applications. He demonstrated Penetration testing and how it works. Then he told us about SQL Injection and precautions to be taken to prevent the same.  He also discussed about XSS (Cross Site Scripting), its working and types of attacks. He mentioned about CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) attacks and its vulnerabilities. He also made the young students realise, how to build a software, keeping in mind the security loop holes and technology glitches. He demonstrated the goal and methodologies of the most commonly occurring DoS Attacks (Denial of Service).

<br/>
A series of exercises were assigned for the students to gain hands-on experience about security breaches.  He explained how certain flaws in the software design can lead to major and serious attacks in the information store.  He made the students aware of using better technologies for software design and application development, regular updates of OS to fix vulnerabilities and alike.  The students were made to work on Kali-Linux, with vitual box installed and make use of powerful terminal commands like nmap, flood, nc etc. 

The entire exercise was to make the students understand the Web-security & its significance and the serious issues that may occur in the absence of security. The workshop also had a clause that students will use the workshop content for learning and understanding only and will not experiment with any real-world application.
